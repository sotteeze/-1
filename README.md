# Tic Tac Toe C++
Tic Tac Toe C++
This project implements a simple game "Tic Tac Toe" in C++ for two players. One player puts a cross, and the other puts a zero. The winner is the player who first finds a line (horizontally, parallel, diagonally) of crosses or zeros. There is a draw in the game, if all the cells of the field are occupied, and none of the players has collected a line, then there is a draw.
